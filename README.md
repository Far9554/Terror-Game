This is a project that I started in October 2022, the idea was to create a horror game inspired by SOMA, with a procedural generation system in the bases. All 3d models and textures were created by me. The procedural generation system is a modification of the classic dungeon procedural generation system with slight modifications.

Here there is a little visualization of the generation of the bases:

 - Dungeon Generator Folder:
In this folder are all the files to generate the bases, the base generation method is created by me, I like to define it as a domino game, the code saves all the rooms that can be generated and then places them in a different way. random even controlling the number of plants.

- Engines Folder:
Contains the code of all the mechanical elements of the game (doors, elevators,...).
