# Terror Game
 
 - Dungeon Generator Folder:
In this folder are all the files to generate the bases, the base generation method is created by me, I like to define it as a domino game, the code saves all the rooms that can be generated and then places them in a different way. random even controlling the number of plants.
- Engines Folder:
Contains the code of all the mechanical elements of the game (doors, elevators,...).
